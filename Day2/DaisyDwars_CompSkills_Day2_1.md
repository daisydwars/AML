_First example_ <br/>

**Shapefile (.shp/.shx/.dbf/.sbn)**: used for Geographic Information 
Systems. It is a nontopological format for storing the 
geometric location of geographic features. They can be 
represented by points, lines or polygons. The shapefile 
format was introduced with ArcView GIS version 2 in the 
early 1990s. Shapefiles can be visualised using ArcMap, 
Esri's main geospatial processing program.
