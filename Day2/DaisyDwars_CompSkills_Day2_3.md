### Data format 3 <br/><br/>

_Third example_ <br/>

**Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) (.nc)**: a data abstraction for storing 
and retrieving multidimensional data. NetCDF is useful for supporting objects 
that contain dissimilar kinds of data in a heterogeneous network environment
and for writing application software that does not depend on application-specific formats.

#### History
The format was originally based on the conceptual model of the Common Data Format 
developed by NASA, but has since diverged and is not compatible with it.
